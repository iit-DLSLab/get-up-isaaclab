## Overview

Reinforcement learning implementations for quadruped get-up task in IsaacLab. It includes different robots, and scripts for sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer.

Features:
- [Concurrent State Estimator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05481)
- [Rapid Motor Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04034)
- [Morphological Symmetries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17320) 
- Identification of robot parameters for sim2real using [pace](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/pace-sim2real) via our repo [sim2real-robot-identification](https://github.com/iit-DLSLab/sim2real-robot-identification)
- Sim-to-Sim in [Mujoco](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco)
- Sim-to-Real in ROS1 and ROS2 

Real-world deployment via:
- [unitree-ros2-dls](https://github.com/iit-DLSLab/unitree-ros2-dls) for unitree robot communication

A list of robots and environments available is described below:

| Robot Model         | Environment Name Pattern                                   |

## Installation and Runs

If you want only to deploy a trained policy on your robot, continue on [README_DEPLOY](https://github.com/iit-DLSLab/get-up-dls-isaaclab/blob/main/README_DEPLOY.md) otherwise on [README_TRAIN](https://github.com/iit-DLSLab/get-up-dls-isaaclab/blob/main/README_TRAIN.md).

**For the train, check first the compatibility with IsaacLab and rsl-rl at the top of this readme. They indicate the releases that we tested.**
